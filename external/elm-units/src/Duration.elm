{-| A `Duration` refers to an elapsed time in seconds, milliseconds, hours etc.,
as opposed to a specific instant in time (which would generally be represented
by a [`Posix`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#Posix)
value). It is stored as a number of seconds.

### Offsetting

`addTo` and `subtractFrom` can be used to offset a [`Time.Posix`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#Posix)
value by a given `Duration`. However, note that `Time.Posix` values are stored
as an integer number of milliseconds, so the offset amount will be rounded to
the nearest number of milliseconds.

## Constants

Shorthand for `Duration.seconds 1`, `Duration.hours 1` etc. Can be convenient to
use with [`Quantity.per`](Quantity#per).

values on the same day:

{-| Construct a `Duration` from a given number of days. A day is defined as
exactly 24 hours or 86400 seconds. Therefore, it is only equal to the length of
a given calendar day if that calendar day does not include either a leap second
or any added/removed daylight savings hours.

{-| Construct a `Duration` from a given number of [Julian years][julian_year].
A Julian year is defined as exactly 365.25 days, the average length of a year in
the historical Julian calendar. This is 10 minutes and 48 seconds longer than
a Gregorian year (365.2425 days), which is the average length of a year in the
modern Gregorian calendar, but the Julian year is a bit easier to remember and
reason about and has the virtue of being the 'year' value used in the definition
of a [light year](Length#lightYears).

{-| Offset a [`Time.Posix`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#Posix)

    -- from Time.now

`Duration.subtractFrom time duration` is equivalent to `Duration.addTo time
