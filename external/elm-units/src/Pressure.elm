{-| A `Pressure` value represents a pressure in kilopascals, pounds per square
inch, [atmospheres][1] etc. It is stored as a number of pascals.

Note that since `Pascals` is defined as `Rate Newtons SquareMeters` (force per
unit area), you can construct a `Pressure` value using `Quantity.per`:

    pressure =
        force |> Quantity.per area

You can also do rate-related calculations with `Pressure` values to compute
`Force` or `Area`:

    force =
        area |> Quantity.at pressure

    area =
        force |> Quantity.at_ pressure
